    <h3>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>

    <h4>1. Why is my data missing after switching devices?</h4>
    <p>TripWander is a <strong>local-first</strong> app. To protect your privacy, data is not uploaded to any server. Before switching devices, please export your trips as a ZIP file and import them on your new device.</p>

    <h4>2. Do I need to pay again after reinstalling the App?</h4>
    <p><strong>No.</strong> The Pro upgrade is a non-consumable, one-time purchase. As long as you use the same Apple ID, you can restore your purchase for free.</p>

    <h4>3. Why can’t I find exported images in Photos?</h4>
    <p>Please ensure that TripWander has photo access enabled in system settings. Exported images are usually saved in the “Recents” album.</p>

    <h4>4. How do I delete a trip entry?</h4>
    <p>On the trip detail timeline, swipe left on the corresponding card to reveal the delete option.</p>
